Created from scratch using Semantic HTML and CSS to create the layout, and vanilla javascript to dynamically generate the posts. an instagram clone.

About this project:

• I used a couple of functions to achieve an easy to maintain code that I will later in my learning journey turn into a fully functional Instagram clone where the posts are randomly generated through different #APIs, with the ability to like and comment on posts while having those actions saved in the local storage.

• The posts images have a lazy load attribute to enhance performance, and I will later specifiy certain image sizes for certain screen sizes to further improve performance.

• I got the design from a figma file provided by Scrimba in their frontend bootcamp that I'm enrolled in.

• It's responsive.
